# Content: Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Creating Customer Segments

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `customer_segments.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `customers.csv` dataset file to complete your work. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for manipulation. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.



## Data

Concrete compressive strength is predicted using various methods. The first step is exploring the data, doing some arbitrary cleaning, and then predicting hte strength.

The database is found at
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/concrete+compressive+strength).
